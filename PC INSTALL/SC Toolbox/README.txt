================================================================
  SC TOOLBOX v1.2 -- Star Citizen Companion Suite
================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
SC Toolbox is a unified launcher for seven interactive Star Citizen
gameplay tools. It runs as a lightweight desktop overlay with global
hotkeys, so you can pull up any tool instantly while playing without
alt-tabbing out of the game. Each tool opens as its own always-on-top
window that you can position, resize, and toggle with a single
keypress.

The toolbox runs fully standalone or as a WingmanAI voice-activated
skill. Data is pulled live from community APIs and cached locally
for speed.

  TOOL GUIDES
================================================================

1. DPS CALCULATOR (Shift+1)
----------------------------
   Data: erkul.games API + UEX Corp API (component prices)

   WHAT IT DOES:
   A full ship loadout viewer and DPS calculator inspired by
   erkul.games. Build and compare ship loadouts with weapons,
   missiles, shields, power plants, coolers, quantum drives,
   thrusters, and radar. Computes DPS, alpha damage, sustained
   damage, power consumption, heat output, and signature levels.
   Component prices are pulled live from UEX Corp.

   LAYOUT:
   Three-panel design:
   - Left panel: Ship selector and component category list.
     Click a category to browse available components.
   - Center panel: Two tabs:
       "Defenses / Systems" -- shields, coolers, radar, armor
       "Power & Propulsion" -- power plant, Q-drive, thrusters
   - Right panel: Weapons and missiles table with DPS columns.
   - Footer: Totals bar showing alpha damage, DPS, heat, and
     signature levels across all components.

   HOW TO USE:
   1. Select a ship from the fuzzy-search dropdown at the top.
      Stock components auto-populate for all hardpoints.
   2. The weapons table on the right shows each gun and turret
      hardpoint with name, size, damage per second (by type:
      physical, energy, distortion, thermal), alpha damage,
      rate of fire, and ammo count.
   3. Click any component row to open a swap picker popup.
      Browse all compatible components, filter by text, and
      click one to slot it into your loadout.
   4. Use the "Leave Empty" button in the picker to remove a
      component from a hardpoint.
   5. Switch between SCM and NAV flight modes to see how power
      consumption changes. SCM has weapons and shields active;
      NAV has quantum drive active.
   6. Component rows show live pricing bubbles from UEX Corp
      with buy locations and prices.

   TIPS:
   - Sustained DPS accounts for overheat and ammo regen, giving
     a more realistic damage number than raw DPS.
   - Use the tutorial button in the title bar for a guided
     walkthrough covering weapons, defenses, and power systems.


2. CARGO LOADER (Shift+2)
--------------------------
   Data: sc-cargo.space + UEX Corp API

   WHAT IT DOES:
   A 3D isometric cargo grid viewer and container packing
   optimizer. Visualizes every cargo bay slot for a ship and
   calculates the best container mix to maximize SCU capacity.
   Supports 30+ ships with pre-made cargo grid layouts.

   HOW TO USE:
   1. Select a ship from the fuzzy-search dropdown. The cargo
      grid layout loads automatically.
   2. The isometric 3D view renders containers color-coded by
      size (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, or 32 SCU).
   3. Select a commodity from the dropdown to see color-coded
      cargo types based on UEX commodity data.
   4. Click in the canvas to place containers. Drag to pan,
      scroll to zoom.
   5. Stats panel shows total SCU, packing efficiency, and
      price summary.

   Clipper, Constellation (all variants), Cutlass (all variants),
   Freelancer (all variants), Hammerhead, Hermes, Idris M/P,
   Mercury Star Runner, MOTH, Polaris, Raft, Reclaimer,
   Retaliator, SRV, Starfarer (both), Zeus CL, and more.

   TIPS:
   - Container sizes follow the in-game standard: 1, 2, 4, 8,
     16, 24, and 32 SCU.
   - Reference loadouts for popular haulers (Caterpillar, C2,
     Taurus) are verified and loaded automatically.


3. MISSION DATABASE (Shift+3)
------------------------------
   Data: scmdb.net (LIVE + PTU)

   WHAT IT DOES:
   A browsable database of all Star Citizen missions, crafting
   blueprints, and mining resource locations. Three pages cover
   different aspects of PvE content, with separate data for
   LIVE and PTU servers.

   LAYOUT:
   Three tabs along the top:
     Missions    -- browse and filter all in-game missions
     Fabricator  -- crafting blueprints and material requirements
     Resources   -- mining resource locations by planet/moon

   LIVE vs PTU:
   Toggle buttons in the title bar switch between LIVE and PTU
   data. The app auto-switches to PTU if no LIVE data is
   available for the current page.

   MISSIONS PAGE:

   2. Each turret panel shows a laser dropdown and two module
      slot dropdowns. Select your mining laser from the list.
   3. Assign up to 2 modules per turret. Active modules have
      limited uses and a duration timer; passive modules are
      always active.
   4. Select a gadget from the gadget dropdown (applies to the
      whole ship, not per-turret).
   5. The stats panel updates live showing:
      - Mining laser power and extraction efficiency
      - Resistance, instability, and charge modifiers
      - Total loadout price with pricing breakdown
   6. Detail cards below the stats show pricing sources and
      buy locations. Cards are expandable and lockable.

   TIPS:
   - Stock lasers are pre-selected when you switch ships.
   - Module effects stack -- two instability reducers give a
     larger total reduction.
   - Active modules like the Stampede give big boosts but have
     limited uses per session.
   - Use the tutorial button for ship-specific loadout tips.


5. MARKET FINDER (Shift+5)
----------------------------
   Data: UEX Corp API v2

   WHAT IT DOES:
   A searchable commodity browser for all tradeable items in

     the refresh interval.


6. TRADE HUB (Shift+6)
------------------------
   Data: UEX Corp API v2

   WHAT IT DOES:
   A trade route calculator that finds profitable single-hop
   and loop trade routes. Filters by location, commodity, and
   ship cargo capacity. Shows profit per run, margin per SCU,
   available stock, and demand at each terminal.

   LAYOUT:
   - Header: location filters, commodity filter, min profit
     input, refresh button, and status display
   - Center: Route table with sortable columns
   - Right: Ship selector with cargo capacity display
   - Routes are color-coded: green (high profit), yellow
     (medium), red (low)

   HOW TO USE:

================================================================
  LAUNCHER SETTINGS
================================================================
Open Settings by clicking the gear icon on the launcher window.
Settings are organized into three tabs:

TOOLS TAB:
  - Enable/disable individual tools (disabled tools are hidden
    from the launcher and their hotkeys are unbound)
  - Customize the hotkey for each tool
  - Set the launcher toggle hotkey

GRID LAYOUT TAB:
  - Rows and columns for the tile grid
  - Layout type: grid or list view
  - UI scale slider (0.75x to 3.0x)

LANGUAGE TAB:
  Select from 12 languages: English, Deutsch, Francais,
  Espanol, Portugues, Italiano, Nederlands, Polski, Russkij,
  Zhongwen, Nihongo, Hangugeo.

ADDITIONAL SETTINGS:
  - Opacity slider: adjust window transparency
  - Auto-hide: launcher hides when a tool is active

WINDOW POSITIONS:
  Each tool remembers its last window position and size.
  Drag any tool window to reposition it. The position is saved
  automatically for the next launch.

SETTINGS FILE:
  All settings are stored in skill_launcher_settings.json.
  You can edit this file manually, but prefer the Settings panel.


================================================================
  TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================
App does not launch:
  If you installed via the installer, try running it as
  administrator. If running from source, make sure Python 3.10+
  is installed and run INSTALL_AND_LAUNCH.bat.

Hotkeys not working:
  Check that no other program is capturing the same key
  combination (Discord overlay, OBS, etc.). Try rebinding to
  a different key in Settings.

Tool window does not appear:
  The tool may have launched off-screen. Delete the settings
  file (skill_launcher_settings.json) to reset all window
  positions, then relaunch.

API timeout or no data:
  Check your internet connection. The APIs (erkul.games,
  uexcorp.space, scmdb.net) must be reachable. If one is down,
  that specific tool will show an error but others will work.

Stale data after a game patch:
  Data caches refresh automatically based on their TTL. To
  force an immediate refresh, delete the cache files in the
  skills/ subdirectories (files starting with a dot, e.g.,
  .erkul_cache.json, .uex_cache.json, .scmdb_cache.json).

Crash dialog appears:
  If a tool crashes, SC Toolbox shows a dialog with the crash
  log. Copy the log contents and report the issue on Discord.

Reporting bugs:
  Join the Discord and describe the issue. Include your Windows
  version and any error messages from the crash dialog or log
  files in the logs/ directory.
