# path) imports ``numpy.testing``, which calls ``platform`` at import time.
# On 3.14 that routes ``platform.win32_ver`` -> ``_wmi_query`` -> a WMI COM
# query that HANGS for minutes on this machine. The first signature/HUD read
# then stalls 90s+, so the live pipeline looks "frozen / not sending results".
# ``platform._win32_ver`` already catches ``OSError`` from ``_wmi_query`` and
# falls back to a fast registry path, so we force that path by disabling the

# ── Field-value lock cache ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Once a field reads a value that PASSES VALIDATION (and has high
# enough CNN confidence), we lock it for the duration the panel
# remains visible. Subsequent scans for the same panel skip the OCR
# work entirely for that field and return the locked value. The
# cache is cleared the moment the panel disappears (mineral row
# undetectable) — i.e. when the user looks away from the rock.
#
# Why locking is necessary even with consensus: the consensus buffer
# requires 2-of-3 agreement to display a value, which means a single
# good frame surrounded by misreads will still show garbage. Locking
# treats the FIRST validated read as truth, and only re-evaluates
# when the panel goes away (rock changed).
#
# Keyed by region (x, y, w, h) so multiple scan regions don't share
# cache state (e.g. two Mining Signals instances).
#
# Each entry stores BOTH the locked value AND the crop fingerprint
# that was in effect when the lock fired. On every subsequent scan
# we compare the current frame's crop fingerprint against the
# stored one; a significant divergence drops the lock and resumes
# OCR. This prevents a wrong locked value from persisting silently
# if the row geometry drifts after locking (e.g. ship moves and the
# panel re-anchors slightly differently).
# LRU bound: long sessions with calibration drift accumulate stale
# region keys forever. _CACHE_MAX caps both _field_lock_cache and
# _difficulty_cache; oldest-touched entries are evicted FIFO, and
# every read/write that hits an existing key bumps it to the end.

# ── Periodic lock re-verification ───────────────────────────────────

# wrong-by-one-digit value (e.g. real 523.33 read as 52.33 because a
# leading digit was clipped). NCC-drift invalidation only triggers when
# the crop GEOMETRY changes — if the row stays in roughly the same
# pixels but its CONTENT was misread, the lock holds indefinitely.
#
# We defend with a periodic forced re-OCR: every Nth pass through the
# "all locked" fast path we re-OCR ONE field (round-robin via the
# counter), and if the fresh read is high-confidence AND disagrees with
# the locked value, invalidate the lock and accept the fresh read.
#
# Per-field counter (keyed by field name, NOT region — the counter is
# only meaningful while the lock holds, and the lock cache is keyed by

    pixels are 255 and background is 0.

    Replaces global Otsu, which assumes the histogram has TWO
    well-separated clusters (text vs background). That assumption
    holds when the panel sits on uniform dark space, but breaks on
    bright sandy / asteroid backgrounds where the BG luminance
    overlaps the text luminance and Otsu picks a threshold that
    either eats the text or admits asteroid noise as text.

    Adaptive threshold sidesteps that entirely: instead of one global
    threshold, every pixel is compared against a Gaussian-weighted
    mean of its local neighbourhood, then marked text iff it's at
    least ``C`` luma units BRIGHTER than that local mean. Background
    luminance can vary across the image without breaking the
    decision rule — only LOCAL contrast matters.

    Note on sign convention: OpenCV's ``cv2.adaptiveThreshold`` with
    ``THRESH_BINARY`` uses ``T = mean - C`` because it targets the
    common case of DARK text on LIGHT background (document scanning).
    We're in the inverse case — BRIGHT text on DARKish background —
    so we test ``pixel > mean + C`` instead. Same idea, opposite
    polarity.

    Parameters chosen for SC HUD digit text (≈24-28 px tall at our
    REF_H scale):
      * ``block_size = 31`` — slightly larger than text height so the
        local window includes the text + a thin BG margin. Too small
        and the window fits inside a single stroke (stroke = its own
        background); too large and the result degrades back toward
        global Otsu.
      * ``C = 15`` — pixels must be ≥15 luma units above local mean
        to count as text. The SC HUD's typical text-vs-BG contrast
        on bright asteroid is ~30-50 units, so 15 leaves margin for
        noise and antialiasing while reliably separating text from
        BG. Tunable per real captures if needed.

    Input must already be in canonical polarity (text BRIGHT). Run
    :func:`_canonicalize_polarity` first.

    The legacy :func:`_adaptive_binarize` uses a single fixed recipe
    (Gaussian local-mean threshold, ``C = 15``) which works on the
    common HUD case but breaks on bubble-glow signal panels where:

      * Heavy chromatic aberration compresses the dynamic range so
        the local-mean window has very low contrast — adaptive
        threshold then either floods the whole crop on (entire crop =
        one merged blob) or admits nothing (mask is mostly empty).
      * The sharp glow gradient around digits drags the local mean
        UP near each glyph, eating a fixed-``C`` margin so the digit
        edges flicker on/off.

    This function tries several recipes and picks whichever one
    produces a column-projection span count CLOSEST to
    ``expected_count`` (4 or 5 for signal values). Each recipe is a
    standard binarization variant, so the worst case is "same result
    as before" — never worse than the legacy single-recipe path.

    Recipes tried (in order, all on canonical-polarity input where
    text is BRIGHT on dark background):

      1. ``otsu_global``    — global Otsu threshold (cheap baseline).
      2. ``percentile_60``  — top-40% bright pixels become ink.
      3. ``percentile_70``  — top-30% bright pixels become ink.
      4. ``percentile_80``  — top-20% bright pixels become ink.
      5. ``adaptive_w11``   — local-mean threshold, finer 11-px window.
      6. ``adaptive_w21``   — local-mean threshold, coarser 21-px window.
      7. ``legacy``         — existing :func:`_adaptive_binarize`.

    Selection: for each recipe's binary mask we compute the column-ink
    projection and count contiguous non-zero column runs whose width
    is in ``[3, work.shape[1] / 2]`` ("good-width" spans). The score
    is ``-abs(good_count - expected_count)`` with extra penalties for
    counts of 1, 2, or >7 (clearly degenerate). Highest score wins;
    ties broken by recipe order (Otsu first, legacy last).

    Returns the chosen ``uint8`` mask (text=255, background=0). If
    ``canon_gray`` is empty, returns an all-zero mask of matching
    shape — same contract as :func:`_adaptive_binarize`.

    Cost: ~7 recipes × ~0.3 ms each = ~2 ms — negligible vs. the

             expected_count+2]`` (i.e. 3-7 for the typical 5-digit

             a single fused-digit pair to take 4→5, so 4 IS in the

    """Segment individual glyphs → (28x28 float32 crops, source bboxes).

    Replicates the EXACT preprocessing the ONNX model was trained on:
      glyph from grayscale → pad with 255 → resize 28x28 → / 255.

    Right-anchored: drops spans before the largest gap between
    consecutive characters. The largest gap usually marks where label-
    text intrusion (e.g. the trailing colon of "RESISTANCE:") ends and
    the actual value begins.

    Set ``disable_gap_cut=True`` for callers whose crops have NO label
    intrusion — region2 (signature) is the canonical example, where
    the world-model crop_box already starts immediately after the
    icon. With gap-cut enabled there, a wide right-edge gap
    (between the rightmost digit and a pill end-cap artifact) gets
    misinterpreted as the label-to-value boundary, dropping every
    real digit on the left of it.

    ``field`` is an optional hint used to tune the leading-narrow-span
    pruning. The pass2/pass3 leading-span droppers were designed to
    strip label residue (colon ticks, AA dots, etc.) from in front of
    the value, but they have a structural blind spot for SHORT
    INSTABILITY values like ``"1.03"``: the raw segmenter correctly
    finds 4 spans (``1``, ``.``, ``0``, ``3``), but the kerning gap
    between ``"1"`` and ``"."`` matches the gap-cut threshold (8 px on
    typical captures) AND the ``.`` itself looks like a narrow leading
    speck to pass3 — both get pruned, leaving ``"03"`` which structurally
    rejects downstream. With ``field="instability"`` we scan the raw
    span list for a dot-shaped INTERIOR span before pass2 fires, and
    when one is present we skip pass2 + pass3 entirely (no leading
    pruning) so the ``1`` and the ``.`` both survive. The rest of the
    fields (mass, resistance, mineral row, signal) keep the original
    aggressive pruning behavior — they have no dot to protect and
    benefit from the label-residue stripping.

    The second tuple element is a parallel list of ``(x, y, w, h)``
    bounding boxes in *source* (pre-normalization) coordinates. Used by
    :func:`_dot_label_from_box` to detect tiny `.` glyphs whose 28×28
    normalization strips the size signal that distinguishes them from
    full-height digits — the CNN routinely misclassifies such crops
    as `0`/`4`/`7` because every glyph occupies the full normalized
    canvas regardless of original size.

    # Why this exists: the projection-based segmenter + 3-pass leading-
    # narrow filter has been observed to drop genuine leading "1"s from
    # SC HUD values (e.g. mass="18629" arriving at the CNN as "8629" —
    # 4 glyphs instead of 5). Multiple failure modes feed this:
    #   1. The "1" is rendered with chromatic aberration → top-flag and
    #      stem are vertically separated → projection creates 2 thin
    #      spans, neither of which individually passes `_looks_like_one`
    #      (which inspects ONE span at a time).
    #   2. The "1" is wider than expected (subpixel AA puffs it up) →
    #      `_looks_like_one`'s aspect-ratio threshold (1.5) rejects it.
    #   3. Pass 2's gap-cut has NO leading-1 guard — if the "1"-to-"8"
    #      kerning gap is wider than digit-to-digit elsewhere in the
    #      number, gap-cut treats it as label-to-value boundary and
    #      drops the "1".
    #
    # The fix: positive evidence detection BEFORE the heuristic passes.
    # We scan the leftmost portion of the row for the SC "1" shape
    # signature — a contiguous run of stroke-density columns with
    # pixels distributed top + middle + bottom of the row. If we find
    # one, we ENSURE a span covering those columns survives all

    Mirrors the HUD's ``_dot_label_from_box`` size-based heuristic but
    inverted: the HUD uses box-width-and-height to *identify* a dot
    that already lives in its own box; here, the comma is fused into
    the preceding digit's box because column-projection segmentation
    saw no zero column between them. The fused box has full digit
    width but its **height** extends below the digit baseline to
    include the comma's pixels.

    Detection: any box whose height is more than
    ``_COMMA_HEIGHT_RATIO`` × median(box heights) — and at least
    ``_COMMA_HEIGHT_ABS_PX`` px taller than the median — has a comma
    fused below the digit. We trim the box back to the median height
    (chops off the comma) and re-extract the 28×28 crop from the
    canonical work image so the CNN sees a clean digit.

    Why height and not width: a comma sits in the same x-columns as
    the trailing edge of the preceding digit (that's why it fuses to
    begin with), so the box's WIDTH stays at digit-width. The
    distinguishing feature is the box's vertical extent reaching
    below the digit baseline.

    Why median rather than absolute: digit heights vary by font /
    capture resolution (~20 px at 1080p, ~28 px at 4K). Median across
    the row is the only stable reference.

    Skipped when the row has fewer than 3 boxes — too few samples for
    a reliable median, and a 1-2-box capture is almost certainly an
    anchor failure where structural recovery is hopeless anyway.

    1. **Below-baseline trim.** Signature digits ``0``-``9`` have
       no descenders — their ink sits entirely between the cap line
       and the baseline. So anything below the LAST row whose ink
       count crosses the digit-body threshold is, by elimination,
       comma / dust / AA halo bleeding under the baseline. We trim
       all those rows to zero. This catches the most common failure
       mode: a comma rendered in the same columns as the trailing
       edge of the preceding digit, where chromatic aberration
       bridges the digit baseline → comma so column-projection
       segmentation sees them as one contiguous run.

    2. **Per-column gap detection.** Catches commas in columns where
       the digit body is narrow enough that AA didn't bridge the
       baseline. We walk each column, find runs of consecutive ink,
       and mask the bottom run when there's a clean gap between it
       and a digit-tall top run (preserves hollow-digit interiors).

    Both run unconditionally — the row-band trim is fast (one
    np.sum + one slice assignment) and idempotent on bands that
    already lack below-baseline ink.

    Signature values are integers in [1000, 35000] formatted with a
    thousands separator: ``D,DDD`` (4 digits) or ``DD,DDD`` (5 digits).
    Two structural priors fall out of that:

    1. **Comma is narrow + short.** A comma-shaped span is < 50% the
       median digit width AND < 60% the median digit height. A digit
       ``1`` is narrow but full-height; a comma is narrow AND short.
       Drop any span matching this shape — the signal CNN's training
       set is digits-only (no comma class), so leaving it in would
       just have the CNN guess a random digit class for it,
       corrupting the read.

    2. **Post-comma count is ALWAYS 3.** When a comma sits at an
       interior index, the spans following it are exactly 3 digits
       (because signature values follow ``D,DDD`` or ``DD,DDD``).
       Pre-comma is 1-2 digits. Trimming to those bounds catches:

       - **Right-edge artifacts**: bubble-edge speckle that the
         segmenter picks up as a "digit" past the real last digit.
         Visible as 4+ post-comma spans where the trailing one is
         narrow/dim. Drop the rightmost extras.
       - **Left-edge residue**: icon body pieces that slipped past
         the blacklist filter, or chromatic-aberration ghost bits.
         Visible as 3+ pre-comma spans. Drop the leftmost extras.

    The signal CNN's hardest-to-disambiguate digit pairs all share
    rounded-rectangle silhouettes — `0` vs `6` vs `8` vs `9` differ
    only in which corners of the silhouette are CLOSED (digit ink
    fills the corner) vs OPEN (background pokes through). At the
    captured signal-panel resolution, those open corners can render
    as 1–3 pixels wide; on the per-glyph 28×28 crop after the
    bilinear resize, they shrink to sub-pixel features that bias the
    CNN's decision toward whichever closed-loop digit fits best.

    Grayscale dilation expands the bright (background) regions in
    each pixel's (size × size) neighborhood. Holes that were 1 px
    wide become 3 px wide; open corners that were ambiguous become
    decisive. The cost is symmetric: digit strokes erode by
    ``(size - 1) / 2`` pixels each side. At ``size = 3`` (1-pixel
    erosion) this is acceptable on SC's signal font where strokes
    are typically 3–5 px wide on the 28×28 crop — strokes thin to
    2–4 px, still classifier-readable, while holes go from 1–2 px to
    3–4 px wide and become unambiguously background.

    Trade-off versus training distribution: the historical training
    pool was extracted WITHOUT this dilation, so applying it at
    inference creates a small train/test mismatch. In the failure
    cases this targets — `6` misread as `8` because the 6's open
    top corner closed up at sub-pixel scale — the mismatch is

    """Cast an N-way vote on a SINGLE digit position.

    ``voter_results`` is a dict mapping voter name (``"primary"``,
    ``"secondary"``, ``"rgb"``, ``"rgb_inv"``) to the per-glyph
    classification at this position — either ``(char, conf)`` or
    ``None`` (voter not available / abstained).

    Consensus rules (in priority order):

      1. **All voters agree** on a single class → that class with
         confidence = mean of contributing votes.
      2. **3-of-N agree** (with at least 3 voters present) → that
         class with confidence = mean of the 3 agreeing votes.
      3. **2-of-N agree AND the agreeing pair includes one gray voter
         and one RGB voter (decorrelated)** → that class with
         confidence = mean of the agreeing pair.
      4. **2-of-N agree on the same polarity tier** (e.g. both gray)
         → flagged with ``needs_lexicon_disambiguation=True`` so the
         caller can decide string-level via the lexicon.
      5. **Otherwise** — sum confidence per candidate class across
         all voters, return the argmax.

    The returned dict carries:

      * ``char`` — consensus character (single digit, ``"@"`` for
        icon, or ``"?"`` if every voter abstained).
      * ``confidence`` — aggregated confidence in [0, 1].
      * ``votes`` — passthrough of input ``voter_results`` for
        downstream debug / lexicon reasoning.
      * ``consensus_path`` — short label describing which rule fired.
      * ``needs_lexicon_disambiguation`` — only ``True`` for path 4.

# ``_canonicalize_polarity`` (text pixels ≈ 1.0, bg pixels ≈ 0.0 in the
# float32 [0, 1] domain). But the four signal CNN models were trained
# on different polarities — verified by sampling their staging dirs:
#
#   training_data_user_sig/0..9 :   median ≈ 190 → DARK-on-LIGHT source
#   training_data_user_sig_rgb/0..9 : median ≈ 200 → DARK-on-LIGHT source
#
# And combining with the trainer behaviour
# (``scripts/train_for_region.py:_load_dataset`` flips ``1.0 - x`` for
# any kind whose name contains ``inv``):
#
#   PRIMARY  (signal)        : trainer NO-flip  → expects DARK-on-LIGHT
#   SECONDARY(signal_inv)    : trainer flips    → expects BRIGHT-on-DARK
#   SIGNAL_RGB(signal_rgb_v2): trainer NO-flip  → expects DARK-on-LIGHT
#   SIGNAL_RGB_INV(rgb_inv)  : trainer flips    → expects BRIGHT-on-DARK
#
# So the runtime (which produces canonical BRIGHT-on-DARK crops) must
# INVERT before feeding PRIMARY and SIGNAL_RGB, and feed AS-IS to
# SECONDARY and SIGNAL_RGB_INV.
#
# Before this routing was in place, PRIMARY (and SIGNAL_RGB) were being
# fed the polarity OPPOSITE to what they were trained on, which caused
# digit misreads on every signature capture in the test suite.

# resized to 28×28 by the simple pad+bilinear in the segmenter's
# ``_crop_to_28x28``, narrow digits (like ``1`` at ~5×24 ink in a
# 14×44 slot) get HORIZONTALLY STRETCHED 2× and VERTICALLY SHRUNK by
# 0.6×. The result is a 28×28 with the digit ink occupying roughly
# the FULL canvas — wildly out of distribution.
#
# Training samples were extracted from real captures with a frame of
# pure padding around the actual ink. Empirical calibration over 100
# samples (10 per class × 10 classes):
#
#   training_data_user_sig (gray)     : larger_dim_med = 0.786 → ~22/28
#   training_data_user_sig_rgb (RGB)  : larger_dim_med = 0.857 → ~24/28
#
# So every gray training sample has the ink's larger bbox dimension
# occupying ~22 of the 28 pixels, with ~3 px of bg padding each side.
# RGB training samples are slightly tighter at 24/28.
#
# The fix: BEFORE handing a crop to the CNN, find the actual ink bbox
# inside the 28×28 canvas, scale it so its larger dimension equals
# ``target_inner`` (22 for gray, 24 for RGB), and re-place it centered
# on a fresh 28×28 canvas with the bg color filling the rest. That
# matches training distribution → CNN classification works.
#
# The helpers below run BEFORE ``_feed_signal_cnn``; the polarity
# routing helper still inverts/passes-through afterwards. Ordering:
# canonical-loose → tight-repad → polarity-route → CNN.

            CANONICAL bright-on-dark polarity (text bright, bg dark).
            Input may be float [0, 1] or uint8 [0, 255].
        skip_padding_ring: if True and input is 28×28, ignore the
            outer 2-px ring during ink detection (those pixels are
            from the segmenter's white-pad-then-resize tail and would
            be misclassified as ink). Default True. Pass False when
            the input is the loose canonical sub (no padding ring).

    Returns:
        28×28 array, same dtype/range as input. Output structure
        mimics training samples' three-tier composition:

          Outer 2-px ring  : padding bright extreme (255 for canon)
          Middle annulus   : pill-bg mid-tier (sampled from input's
                             non-ink, non-chrome pixels)
          Inner            : digit ink centered, larger dim = 22 px

        Caller hands the result to :func:`_feed_signal_cnn` for
        per-model polarity routing.

    Why three-tier output: training samples were extracted from real
    captures with the panel-pill bg embedded in the 28×28 (median ~200
    for gray). A two-tier output (pure ink + pure padding) lacks the
    mid-tier the CNN was trained to recognize as "digit lives inside
    a frame." Empirically: synthetic two-tier inputs misclassify as
    different digits than three-tier inputs of the same shape.

    Polarity-safe by construction: identical input array, identical bg

    segmenter's tail) all PAD their per-glyph crops with 255 (white) on
    a 2-pixel border before resizing to 28×28. The training-data
    extractor uses the same convention. So the bright border around a
    glyph is a SHARED CONVENTION between training and inference — both
    polarities have a bright outer ring.

    A naive ``1.0 - crop`` inversion flips the bright border to dark,
    creating a dark ring around the glyph that the model never saw at
    training time. Empirically this caused the gray PRIMARY model to
    classify every input as the icon (@) class because the dark
    border looked like the icon's silhouette boundary.

    The fix: after inverting, RESTORE the corner-padding pixels (the
    outer ring) to their pre-inversion bright value. We detect padding
    pixels as those whose pre-inversion value is at the BRIGHT extreme
    of the crop's range — the segmenters set them to 255 / 1.0
    explicitly so they're trivially separable.

    Float crops in [0, 1] are inverted via ``1 - crop``; uint8 crops in
    [0, 255] are inverted via ``255 - crop``. The data type and shape are
    preserved.

    ``model_name`` must be one of ``_CNN_POLARITY`` keys: ``primary``,
    ``secondary``, ``rgb``, ``rgb_inv``. An unknown name returns the
    crop unchanged with a debug log — defensive so a typo never breaks
    classification entirely.

# a vote, never veto one. In the dual-agree gate (primary + secondary
# match → accept), if this RGB voter agrees with the primary (with both
# at reasonable mean confidence), accept the read even if secondary
# disagreed. Captures cases where the polarity-inverted secondary is
# misled by chromatic aberration but the colour-aware RGB voter sees

    Loads ``ocr/models/model_hud_crnn_rgb.onnx`` on first call,

    Parameters
    ----------
    value_crop : PIL.Image
        The HUD value sub-region — output of ``_find_value_crop``
        for a mass / resistance / instability row.
    field : str
        One of ``"mass"`` / ``"resistance"`` / ``"instability"``.
        Used for:
          * per-field alphabet mask before softmax-argmax (mass is
            digits only; resistance allows ``%``; instability allows
            ``.``)
          * plausibility-aware beam rerank when ``beam_width > 0``
    beam_width : int, optional
        When ``> 0``, use prefix-beam-search CTC with the given beam
        width (typical 8) and rerank candidates by per-field
        plausibility. When ``0`` (default), use greedy CTC — kept as
        the default for back-compat with callers that haven't opted
        in to beam decode.

    Returns
    -------
    ``(digit_string, mean_confidence)`` on success, ``None`` when:
      * the ONNX model isn't on disk yet (e.g. before training has
        finished),
      * onnxruntime / inference fails,
      * the crop is too small to be meaningful.

    The caller (``_ocr_value_crop``) gates the returned read by
    length + confidence + field-specific format before accepting.

    #     geometry better than bilinear (which a naive downstream
    #     resize-to-28×28 would otherwise apply).

    """Rerank HUD beam-search candidates by lexicon membership.

    ``candidates``: list of ``(text, log_prob, geom_mean_conf)``
    pre-sorted by ``log_prob`` descending (output of
    ``_prefix_beam_search_ctc``).

    Semantics — PROMOTE in-lexicon candidates, never REJECT
    out-of-lexicon ones:

    1. The greedy/highest-mean baseline winner is always ``candidates[0]``
       (the beam's top by joint log-probability is what greedy would
       have picked too on a non-degenerate distribution; if not, the
       caller passes us a beam list with mean-confidence tracked).
    2. For each candidate we parse its digit-string to a float using
       the SAME per-field convention the gate uses (digits + optional
       ``.`` collapsed to a single number; ``%`` is stripped).
    3. Candidates whose parse FAILS or whose parsed value is NOT in
       ``hud_lexicon.get_values(field)`` are skipped silently.
    4. Among the lexicon-confirmed survivors we pick the one with the
       HIGHEST geometric-mean confidence (not log-prob — mean conf is
       the quantity the downstream gate compares against its accept
       thresholds, so picking by mean-conf keeps the accept/reject
       boundary stable across rerank vs. greedy).
    5. If NO candidate is lexicon-confirmed (typical at cold start
       when the lexicon is empty), we return ``candidates[0]``
       unchanged — the rerank is a strict no-op in that case, so an
       empty lexicon cannot regress the greedy baseline.

    Why this works when the earlier plausibility-rerank didn't:
    plausibility was a CONTINUOUS predicate (resistance 0-100,
    instability 0-200, mass open-ended) — almost every CRNN read of
    any digit string lands inside it, so promotion was driven by the
    arbitrary tie between two confident reads. Lexicon membership is
    a DISCRETE predicate — a 100-entry-per-field LRU set of values
    the user has actually seen this session — so the rerank only
    fires when there's a *specific* in-lexicon alternative to a
    not-in-lexicon top candidate. Mirrors the signature CRNN's
    beam+lexicon win (664-value discrete chart-derived set).

    Returns ``(picked_candidate, info)`` where ``info`` is a dict
    with diagnostics for the call-site log line::

    work crop and return ``(digit_string, mean_confidence)`` — or, when
    ``return_alignment=True``, ``(digit_string, mean_confidence,
    alignment_info)``.

    Preprocessing mirrors training exactly:
      1. Lanczos resize to height=48 preserving aspect.
      2. Polarity-canonicalize per channel via ``_canonicalize_polarity``.
      3. Normalize to float32 in [0, 1].
      4. Forward pass through ``model_signal_crnn_rgb.onnx``.
      5. CTC decode:
           * ``beam_width <= 0`` (default) → greedy decode — collapse
             consecutive same-class predictions, drop blanks.
           * ``beam_width >= 2`` → prefix-beam-search with width K.
             If ``lexicon`` is provided, the final top-K candidates
             are reranked: prefer the highest-scoring candidate whose
             digit-only integer is in ``lexicon`` AND in
             ``[1000, 35000]``; otherwise fall back to the highest-
             scoring candidate (matches greedy behavior on lexicon-
             miss).

    When ``return_alignment=True`` the decoder ALWAYS falls back to
    greedy. The alignment-box extraction uses argmax runs and isn't
    well-defined for beam-search paths — and no current caller needs
    beam-search alignment.

    Returns ``None`` when:
      * the ONNX model isn't on disk yet,
      * onnxruntime / inference fails,
      * the input strip is too narrow / tall to be meaningful.

    The caller (``_signal_recognize_pil``) gates the returned digit
    string by length + numeric range + confidence before accepting.
    Bad reads (low conf, wrong-length, out-of-range) fall through to
    the existing per-glyph gates.

    # ─── STANDALONE SEGMENTER COUNT (CRNN-independent) ───
    # The COUNT-MISMATCH/WIDTH-FUSION block above only runs when the
    # HUD-RGB CRNN returned a read AND that read survived the format /
    # threshold gates (``_hudr_pass = True``). Three real failure modes
    # are missed by that gating:
    #
    #   1. ``_hud_rgb_crnn is None`` — model file missing, onnxruntime
    #      error, or ``_classify_hud_value_via_crnn_rgb`` returned None
    #      for any other reason. The entire ``if _hud_rgb_crnn is not
    #      None:`` block is bypassed.
    #   2. CRNN ran but format gate rejected the read BEFORE
    #      COUNT-MISMATCH could observe it. Example: mass crop showing
    #      ``10810``, CRNN reads ``"9"`` (single-digit). ``_hudr_ok``
    #      becomes False because mass requires ``len >= 2 or text ==
    #      "0"``, so ``_hudr_pass`` is False, and the COUNT-MISMATCH
    #      block at line ``if _hudr_pass and field in (...)`` skips.
    #   3. CRNN ran, format passed, threshold passed, COUNT-MISMATCH /
    #      WIDTH-FUSION accepted (i.e. CRNN agrees with segmenter), but
    #      the CRNN's read is still wrong in some other way (e.g.
    #      mis-classified individual digit) AND the CRNN returns early
    #      at line 8583. In that case this block doesn't run — but
    #      that's fine because the CRNN's text is what gets returned
    #      anyway, no cascade involved.
    #
    # In failure modes 1 and 2 the cascade below runs WITHOUT a
    # segmenter-derived count, COUNT ORACLE has no override, the multi-
    # binarizer falls back to its field default (``_bin_expected = 4``
    # for mass), and a 5-digit crop gets binarized toward 4 spans —
    # producing the user's observed reads of ``"1610"`` / ``"110"``
    # instead of ``"10810"``.
    #
    # Originally (commit 8116c6d) this block only fired when the
    # segmenter found a wide-fused tile (≥ 1.6× median width). But the
    # production log at 19:22:17 showed the segmenter's FIRST pass on
    # the same crop returning a clean 5-span read with NO fusion at
    # all (widths=[13, 21, 20, 13, 22]). The fusion only appears in
    # the multi-binarizer's second pass when ``_bin_expected = 4`` is
    # used as the field default, because the scorer picks the recipe
    # whose output matches that wrong target.
    #
    # The fix: when the segmenter gives a confident multi-span count,
    # trust it directly. We use TWO independent paths:
    #   * ``_wf_visible_count``: visible digit-shaped spans (mirrors
    #     the existing height-consistency filter to drop label
    #     intrusion).
    #   * ``_wf_width_extra``: hidden digits inside wide-fused tiles
    #     (kept from the original block — covers the case where the
    #     single-recipe binarizer ALSO produces fusion).
    # The true count is the sum, capped at a sensible upper bound (7)
    # to defend against runaway over-counts from broken crops.
    #
    # The block is a no-op (early-exit) when COUNT-MISMATCH /
    # WIDTH-FUSION above already populated ``_hud_count_from_segmenter``
    # — no need to re-run the segmenter on the same crop.

         (signal_anchor.find_digit_crop_box). The icon is a fixed-
         shape UI element that NEVER changes across rocks/sessions

         caption, distance text, etc. that are below the number).
      4. **Multi-PSM/scale Tesseract** OCR of the crop. The icon is
         already excluded so Tesseract only sees the digits — much
         higher accuracy than the legacy 3-engine vote.

    # upscale (see hud_tracker/anchors/compare_crnn_rgb.py
    # ``_normalize_to_work_rgb`` — that's the function the training
    # data was generated from).
    #
    # Production currently feeds the CRNN bytes that have been
    # through both transforms. The comma extension in particular can
    # push x1 left by 60-70 px on captures where the comma detector
    # picks up a noisy left-edge artifact, dragging icon/pill pixels
    # into the CRNN input and causing it to read e.g. "8276" as
    # "2525" / "21,520" / "21,350". The 2x Lanczos compounded with

    # and stash it so the CRNN call site below can derive its own
    # ``_work_rgb_for_crnn`` that matches what training saw. The
    # per-glyph CNN path keeps using ``crop_box`` post-extension and
    # the 2x-upscaled ``_work_rgb`` — those are calibrated to its

    #     captured with digits ~28–32 px tall, which then went
    #     bilinear-resized 30→28 (slight downscale = sharp). Runtime
    #     panels at 1080p come in with digits ~14–18 px tall, which

    Mirrors :func:`_signal_cnn_at_tess_boxes` for everything *after*
    span resolution, but does its own segmentation via
    ``extract_labeled_glyphs._segment_digits`` (column-projection /
    width-equalising splitter). Lets the CRNN primary path obtain a
    second opinion *without* paying the ~1.2 s cost of a full Tesseract
    ensemble.

    Parameters
    ----------
    work_gray : (H, W) uint8 ndarray
        The post-row-isolation grayscale digit cluster — the same array
        ``_signal_recognize_pil`` feeds to CRNN. The segmenter expects
        the comma to already be absent; ``_isolate_main_row`` keeps
        only the dominant text band so commas in the SC font do segment
        as a separate sub-MIN_SPLIT_WIDTH span and drop out below.

    Returns
    -------
    None when ANY of:
      * ``model_signal_cnn.onnx`` missing or session load failed
      * the inverted-polarity HUD CNN failed to load (we require both
        polarities to vote — single-CNN doesn't carry enough evidence
        to over-rule CRNN)
      * the segmenter found <4 or >5 digit-shaped spans
      * any per-digit dual-polarity vote disagreed (mirrors
        ``_signal_cnn_at_tess_boxes``'s polarity-disagree → bail)
      * any glyph crop failed to normalize to 28×28
      * the wall-clock budget overran (sets the tick-skip flag)

    Returns ``(digits, per_digit_confs, per_digit_crops)`` on success:
      * ``digits``: ``"17020"``-style string of 4–5 chars, no comma
      * ``per_digit_confs``: float list of softmax-max-of-primary, same
        length as ``digits``
      * ``per_digit_crops``: list of uint8 28×28 ndarrays (the same
        shape as the training data) — useful for the diagnostic dump.

    Best-effort: any unexpected exception logs at DEBUG and returns
    None. MUST NEVER raise to the caller.

#
# The mineral name is the ONLY line in the scan panel whose text carries a
# "(ORE)" / "(RAW)"-style parenthesized suffix (86 of the 129 annotated
# panels; RAW ICE and bare names have none). A high-confidence NCC match
# of BOTH parens, correctly ordered with a suffix-sized gap, is therefore
# a near-unambiguous "this line is the name" signal — stronger than the
# bottom-most-run heuristic when transient ink (particles, composition
# rows inside a mis-anchored cap) adds junk lines.
#
# Calibrated 2026-06-11 on the annotated corpus: true name parens score
# open 0.96-0.99 / close 0.87-0.93; the best impostor (the 'C' of RAW
# ICE) tops out at 0.80; the difficulty meter's real "( EASY )" parens
# score only ~0.59 (different glyph scale) AND sit ~25 template-widths
# apart vs 4-5 for "(ORE)" — rejected by score and by gap. Washed-out
# panels (0916xx cluster) render glyphs embossed (dark core/bright halo)
# and cap at ~0.66 — undetectable without admitting RAW ICE impostors,
# so those intentionally fall through to the legacy heuristic.

    Multi-pass strategy — robust against dark backgrounds with
    chromatic aberration, light backgrounds with low text-vs-bg
    contrast, and small text where a single PSM choice misreads.

    Pass plan (fail fast on a confident match, otherwise vote):

      Fast path (single attempt, ~50 ms):
        max-of-RGB channels, scale=60px, PSM 7 → fuzzy match.
        If similarity ≥ 0.85, return immediately.

      Slow path (up to 7 more attempts, ~350 ms total):
        Try alternates across {luma, max-channel, max-channel inverted}
        × {scale 60, scale 90} × {PSM 7, PSM 8}, collect every fuzzy
        match with its similarity score, then vote: most-frequent
        canonical name wins; ties broken by max similarity.

    Returns the canonical mineral name on success or None when no
    pass produced a fuzzy-match-able read. Refusing to return raw
    OCR keeps single-letter Tesseract noise out of the break bubble's
    Resource: row.
