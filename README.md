## Download & Install

**[Download the latest installer](https://github.com/ScPlaceholder/SC-Toolbox-Beta-V2/releases/latest)** — no Python required, everything is bundled.

1. Download `SC_Toolbox_Setup_X.Y.Z.exe`
2. Run the installer (no admin rights needed — installs per-user)
3. Launch from the desktop shortcut or Start Menu
4. First launch: press **Shift + `** to open the launcher, then click any tile or use its hotkey

## What's New in v2.2.8

- **RGB CNN voter for Mining Signals** — the SC_OCR pipeline now runs an RGB-trained CNN (plus a per-channel-inverted variant) as the primary digit reader, with the original grayscale CNN, CRNN, and Tesseract as fallback voters. Stops losing thin-stroke digits like 9s in low-contrast frames and reads faster on the high-confidence path.
- **Glyph reviewer drag-select + augmentation cascade** — the training-data review tool (`scripts/review_glyphs.py`) now supports bounding-box drag-select for picking multiple glyphs in one sweep, and automatically moves a sample's augmented siblings (`aug_*.png`) when you re-classify the original.
- **Stability fixes** — multi-recipe adaptive binarization for wide signature spans, equal-width splitter when blobs survive binarization, glyph-height-proportional comma masking, and a hysteresis gate on signal-value acceptance to suppress single-frame OCR jitter.
- **Bundled-runtime fixes** — `scipy` now correctly declared in the Mining_Signals runtime requirements (was silently missing). Paddle sidecar pip uses `--only-binary=:all:` to avoid the Rust-toolchain-required `python-bidi` sdist on Python 3.13.

### SC_OCR — purpose-built for Star Citizen

Mining Signals previously relied on stock Tesseract, which struggled with the SC HUD's sparse digits, anti-aliased glyphs, and varying background luminance. v2.2.6 introduces **SC_OCR**: a CNN-based reader trained on actual in-game captures. Highlights:

- **Adaptive (locally-windowed) thresholding** — handles bright vs dark backgrounds without hand-tuning
- **Position-based row finder with lock cache** — once a row is found, subsequent frames lock onto it for stability and speed
- **Multi-frame averaging** — smooths out transient OCR noise from animated panels
- **Glyph-level confidence** — per-digit classification scores, with an optional live "Glyph Reader" debug view
- **Self-curating training pipeline** — captures, auto-labels (with consensus voting), quarantines contaminated samples, and stages new data for review

You don't need to do anything to use SC_OCR — it ships pre-trained inside Mining Signals.
