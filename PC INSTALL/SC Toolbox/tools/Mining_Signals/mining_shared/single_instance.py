"""Cross-process single-instance enforcement for SC Toolbox tools.

The user has three calibration-adjacent tools that must NEVER run in
parallel:

  * Mining HUD OCR Calibration dialog  (slot ``calibration_dialog``)
  * SC-OCR Panel Finder                (slot ``panel_finder``)
  * Signature Finder                   (slot ``signature_finder``)

Each slot is implemented as a localhost TCP port reservation. The
first process to bind the port owns the slot and runs a tiny
``QTcpServer`` that accepts incoming connections; any byte received
counts as a "raise yourself" request. Subsequent processes that try
to bind the same port get an OS-level address-in-use error, take that
as proof someone else owns the slot, send a single byte to the
holder so it pops to the front, and exit cleanly.

Why TCP-port-bind and not a lockfile or QSharedMemory:
  * The port is auto-released when the holding process dies (even on
    crash) — no stale-lock cleanup needed.
  * The same primitive serves BOTH "is anyone home?" detection AND
    "raise yourself" signalling in one round-trip.
  * Works identically across Python interpreters launched from
    different .bat files (the popout in calibration_dialog.py and
    the standalone script in scripts/ both share the slot).

Loopback-only binding means no Windows firewall popup. Ports live in
the IANA dynamic range (49152-65535) so they don't clash with
well-known services.

Usage from a standalone script:

    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    win = MyWindow()
    guard = SingleInstance("signature_finder", win)
    if not guard.acquire():
        # Someone else owns the slot. acquire() already poked them
        # to raise their window. Just exit.
        sys.exit(0)
    win.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec())

Usage from a popout opener (the calibration dialog opening the panel
finder window inside the same Qt process):

    guard = SingleInstance("panel_finder", popout_window)
    if not guard.acquire():
        # A standalone instance is already running. Surface a status
        # message and don't open a duplicate.
        self._status_bar.showMessage("Panel Finder is already open", 4000)
        return
    popout_window._single_instance = guard   # keep ref alive
    popout_window.show()
