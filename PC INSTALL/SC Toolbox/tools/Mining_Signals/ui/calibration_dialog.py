"""Mining HUD OCR calibration dialog.

User flow:
  1. Open dialog (from "Calibrate Mining Crops" button in scan bar)
  2. Tool starts streaming the live OCR-detected crops in real time
  3. For each row (Resource / Mass / Resistance / Instability):
       - User adjusts the bounding box if needed (drag to resize)
       - When the crop "looks right", user clicks "🔒 Lock <ROW>"
       - Lock button turns GREEN, that row is saved to disk immediately
  4. When all 3 required rows are locked, "CALIBRATION COMPLETE"
     banner appears in big text
  5. User closes dialog; runtime now uses the saved coords directly,
     skipping all detection

Tabs:
  • Calibrate — the live streaming + lock UI
  • Tutorial — how-to text + screenshot examples
  • (future) Voice — narrated walkthrough via Wingman TTS

The dialog is intentionally large + non-modal so the user can
continue to see the actual game HUD beside it for visual comparison.

<h2 style="color:#33dd88;">Why calibrate?</h2>
<p>The Mining Signals OCR engine reads the values in your in-game
SCAN RESULTS panel (MASS / RESISTANCE / INSTABILITY) so it can match
rocks to your fleet's breakability and surface them in the floating
HUD bubble.</p>

<p>Detecting <i>where</i> those values sit on screen is harder than
reading them. Backgrounds change (asteroid surface, deep space,
planet sky), HUD labels can be abbreviated, and panels render at
different positions depending on your resolution and HUD scale.</p>

<p>Calibration solves all of that with a one-time setup: you confirm
where each value sits, and the OCR uses your confirmed coordinates
forever after — no detection, no drift.</p>

<h2 style="color:#33dd88;">How to calibrate</h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>Open the SCAN RESULTS panel in-game.</b> Aim your mining
      laser at any rock until the panel appears.</li>
  <li><b>Watch the live crops.</b> Each row in the dialog shows the
      live OCR crop — the rectangle of pixels being fed to the
      digit recognizer. The crops update every ~0.4 seconds.</li>
  <li><b>For each row, when the crop looks right:</b>
      <ul>
          <li>The value digits should be FULLY VISIBLE
              (no label text on the left, no missing digits)</li>
          <li>The crop should NOT include parts of the row above
              or below it</li>
      </ul>
      Click <b style="color:#2a8;">🔒 Lock</b>. The row's border
      and lock button turn <b style="color:#2a8;">green</b>, and the
      crop coordinates are saved to disk immediately.</li>
  <li><b>Repeat for all three rows</b> (Mass, Resistance,
      Instability). The Resource (mineral name) row is optional.</li>
  <li>When all three are locked, the dialog displays
      <b style="color:#2a8;">"CALIBRATION COMPLETE"</b> in
      large text at the top. You can now close the dialog.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="color:#33dd88;">When to recalibrate</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You change the screen resolution or HUD scale</li>
  <li>You switch between full-label and short-label HUD modes
      (e.g. helmet HUD vs. ship scanner panel)</li>
  <li>You move the user-defined HUD scan region</li>
</ul>

<p>To recalibrate, just open this dialog again. Click
<b style="color:#a44;">Reset all calibration</b> to start fresh, or
<b style="color:#888;">🔓 Unlock</b> a single row to redo just that
one.</p>

<h2 style="color:#33dd88;">Where is the calibration saved?</h2>

<p>Per-user file at:</p>
<p><code style="color:#fb0;">%LOCALAPPDATA%\\SC_Toolbox\\sc_ocr\\calibration.json</code></p>

<p>Calibration persists across toolbox restarts and updates. Multiple
HUD regions get separate calibrations (keyed by region geometry),
so you can switch between setups without losing your work.</p>

        NOW — not whatever frame the last OCR scan happened to capture
        (which could be many seconds old, or never if scanning is
        paused).

        Strategy per row:
          * locked → re-crop the LIVE HUD/signature capture using the
            locked rectangle. The user sees the locked region track
            the live screen, so they can verify the box still
            captures the right content as the game state changes.
          * seeded-manual → same, but with the placeholder rectangle
            the user nudged from. So the ✏ Set rectangle is also
            visibly persistent.
          * auto-detect → ask the existing ``_find_label_rows`` (HUD)
            or ``get_last_signal_crop_box`` (signature) for the
            current detected box, then re-crop from the live capture.

        Cost mitigation:
          * Skip the entire tick if the user just interacted (within
            ``INPUT_PAUSE_MS``). Keeps slider drags / spinner clicks
            from competing with screen capture for GUI thread time.
          * One mss capture per region (HUD + signature) per tick,
            shared across all rows in that region.
          * ``_find_label_rows`` only runs when at least one row is
            in auto-detect mode AND the cached result is stale (older
            than ``LABEL_DETECT_INTERVAL_S``). Locked + manual rows
            skip detection entirely.
          * Per-row freshness: rows that received a broadcast crop
            within the last ``BROADCAST_FRESHNESS_S`` seconds skip
            this tick (the broadcast is more authoritative).

        Defensive: every step is wrapped so a screen-capture failure
        or label-match exception doesn't kill the timer.
