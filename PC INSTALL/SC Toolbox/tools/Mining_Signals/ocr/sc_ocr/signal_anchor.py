"""NCC-based icon anchor for the signal scanner.

The location-pin icon ALWAYS appears to the left of the signal
number in every signature scan, regardless of resource type or
signal value. Only its color changes (cyan / orange / etc); its
shape is identical pixel-for-pixel after polarity canonicalization.

This module wraps the same NCC machinery sc_ocr's label-row finder
uses for HUD labels, but trains the templates from the blacklisted
icon image. Returns the icon's pixel position so callers can crop
the digit cluster at a known offset.

The blacklist directory was originally created so glyph extraction
could REJECT icon-shaped tiles. We re-purpose those same icon PNGs
as positive ANCHOR templates here. One-stop registration.

    """Filter NCC candidates to those the multi-voter accepts as the
    location-pin icon.

    History (old strict-AND path):
      The previous implementation chained the gray CNN re-rank, a
      leftmost-only filter, and the geometric validator as a strict
      AND-gate. When the gray CNN was uncertain (which happens
      whenever a candidate is off the training distribution — a digit
      cluster, a partial icon match, or a chromatic-aberrated icon
      crop), the entire pipeline rejected every candidate, including
      the real icon, and the anchor would fall back to its temporal
      cache (or to nothing).

    New voter path:
      Each NCC candidate (after the leftmost-only positional filter)
      runs through ``vote_on_icon_candidate`` from
      ``hud_tracker.anchors.icon_voter``. The voter consults FOUR
      detectors arranged in three tiers:

        Primary tier (decorrelated structural detectors):
          1. ``find_icon_by_geometry`` — HSV warm-color +
             teardrop / oval / notch checks.
          2. ``find_icon_by_contour`` — luma + edge contour matched
             against the canonical icon silhouette. Built by a
             parallel agent; the voter imports it defensively.
        Secondary tier (RGB CNN with @ class):
          ``model_signal_rgb_cnn_v2.onnx``. Trained by a parallel
          agent; loaded defensively.
        Tertiary tier (existing grayscale CNN with @ class):
          ``model_signal_cnn.onnx``. The classifier that used to be
          the single AND-gate now gets ONE vote of four — no longer
          a precondition.

      When the parallel-agent outputs are missing, the voter degrades
      gracefully: contour abstains, RGB v2 abstains, and the gray
      CNN's vote stands alone in the lone-primary fall-through path.

    Calling-convention notes:

      * The voter receives ALL NCC candidates, not just the ones the
        gray CNN accepts. The gray CNN's classification is now an
        input to the voter, not a gate.
      * The leftmost-only positional filter (a pure precision guard
        that drops digit-cluster false positives at the right of the
        panel) still runs FIRST, because position is unrelated to
        class identity and applies regardless of voter outcome.
      * When ``rgb_image`` is None (the auto-annotator's
        ``detect_icon`` adapter passes only gray), the voter operates
        in gray-only mode: only the tertiary tier votes, mirroring
        the legacy single-gate behavior so existing callers don't
        regress.
      * If the voter import fails (shouldn't happen, but be safe) we
        return the input list unchanged.

    The NCC anchor often matches only a sub-portion of the location-pin
    icon — typically the bottom-tip — when an undersized template scale
    wins the score race. The icon's body (round head + tail) extends
    well beyond the matched rectangle; if we don't expand, the digit
    crop starts past only the matched fragment and the icon's body
    falls into the digit region.

    Two-stage expansion:
      1. **Column/row scan** in canonical polarity (icon = bright).
         From the matched box edges, walk outward column by column
         (or row by row). A column counts as "icon ink" if its bright-
         pixel count is at least 12% of the match height (low enough
         to catch the icon's thin tail, high enough to ignore noise).
         Stop expanding when we hit ``MAX_GAP`` consecutive columns
         (rows) below threshold — that's the gap between the icon and
         the leading digit.
      2. **Connected-component** check (scipy if available) to confirm
         the expanded box only contains ONE component. If it absorbs
         the leading digit (component span > 4× match), bail and
         return the original.

    Capped at ``max_expansion_factor`` × match dimensions per side so
    a runaway can't consume the leading digit even when both stages

    """Locate the signature's digit cluster directly via shape pattern.

    A complementary anchor to ``find_icon``. Where ``find_icon`` does
    NCC template matching for the location-pin icon, this function
    finds the DIGITS by their structural pattern: a leftmost cluster
    of 4–6 digit-shaped column-spans within a single horizontal row.

    The signal CNN reports 99.47% val accuracy on individual digits
    against ~5,000 real samples per class, so digit segmentation is
    a structurally stronger signal than icon NCC at small template
    scales (where the icon's silhouette is confusable with cramped
    multi-character clusters like ``16,``).

    Robustness over icon NCC:
      * No template-scaling needed — column projection adapts to the
        font size in the captured panel automatically.
      * No polarity-mismatch edge cases — adaptive binarization works
        on either polarity once canonicalized.
      * Multiple redundant glyphs offset single-frame NCC noise.
      * The 4–6-glyph + comma pattern is structurally unique in the
        signal panel; nothing else looks like it.

    Algorithm:
      1. Polarity-canonicalize input so text is bright.
      2. Adaptive-binarize.
      3. Row projection → find the contiguous Y-band with most ink
         (the digit row).
      4. Within that band, column projection → segment into
         (x1, x2) spans.
      5. For each span, compute its actual bounding box.
      6. Filter by digit-typical dimensions (height 8–25, width 2–16).
      7. Cluster spans by horizontal adjacency (gap ≤ icon_h px).
      8. Find the LEFTMOST cluster with 4–7 members and return its
         bounding box (4 = ``DDDD``; 7 = ``DDD,DDD`` worst case).

    Returns ``(x1, y1, x2, y2)`` in original-image coords, or None

                            succeeded and agree (gap 0-50 px). HIGH
                            confidence; crop is structurally validated.
      * ``"digit_only"``  — only digit-cluster anchor succeeded (icon
                            NCC missed). Still trustworthy because the
                            digit cluster is the more specific signal.
      * ``"icon_only"``   — only icon NCC succeeded; digit-cluster
                            pattern NOT matched (no 4-7 digit-shaped
                            spans found in the image). DEGENERATE —
                            the crop is guessed from icon position
                            and may contain no actual digits. Callers
                            should refuse lexicon-relaxed acceptance
                            on results from icon-only crops, to
                            prevent hallucinating known-lexicon
                            values from noise when the rock has
                            left view.
      * ``"none"``        — both anchors missed; no crop returned.

    Thread-safety: the SCAN_HUD_ONNX pipeline serializes signature
    scans per process tick (single-thread per region scan), so the
    module-level flag is consistent across the call chain within
    one scan. The flag is set EVERY call so a stale value from a
    previous scan can't leak into a current one's gating decision.

    ``find_digit_cluster`` (4–7 glyph spatial pattern) on the same
    panel. Combine their results:

      * **Both succeed AND agree** (icon's right edge sits 0–50 px
        before the digit cluster's left edge): high-confidence path,
        use the digit cluster's tight bbox as the crop. Most reliable.
      * **Both succeed but disagree** (icon found far from digit
        cluster, or vice versa): trust the digit cluster — its 4–7-
        glyph pattern is structurally more specific than icon NCC.
      * **Only digit cluster found**: use it. Icon NCC failed
        (chromatic aberration knocked the score below threshold) but
        digit pattern is intact.
      * **Only icon found**: fall back to the legacy icon-edge crop
        (icon's right edge + gap → image right edge).
      * **Neither**: return None.

    ``min_score`` defaults to 0.40 (matches the legacy fallback). The
    icon's NCC score wobbles 0.40–0.70 on chromatically-aberrated SC
    HUDs; a higher threshold rejected the icon ~half the time. With
    the digit-cluster anchor backing it up, even when NCC fails the
